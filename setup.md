# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher).
- Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js).
- Install a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and ensure it is running.

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dbmsbackend.git
   cd dbmsbackend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     DB_HOST=your-database-host
     DB_USER=your-database-username
     DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
     DB_NAME=your-database-name
     ```

4. Run database migrations (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## Additional Notes

- For testing, run:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Ensure the database service is running before starting the project.
